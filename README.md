The matrices+sort widget hides itself for strings >50 chars long; it starts to really lag at 10s of chars. Each letter is a separate `<text>` element in an `<svg>`; maybe with a `<canvas>` I could do better? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The bottom two rows are the BWT, and a naively run-length-encoded (RLE) BWT. For all the examples here, the latter uses more characters than the former; in production use there would be some other transfrom applied to the RLE'd BWT, that would really reduce the space occupied, perhaps? And/or: larger data sizes, beyond what can be viz'd here, would exhibit better savings from RLE.
